                <p>Almighty God, who through your only-begotten Son Jesus Christ overcame death and opened to us the gate of everlasting life: Grant that we, who celebrate with joy the day of the Lord’s resurrection, may, by your life-giving Spirit, be delivered from sin and raised from death; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.

or this:

O God, who for our redemption gave your only begotten Son
to die upon the Cross, and by his glorious resurrection delivered
us from the devil and the power of death: Grant us grace to
die daily to sin, that we may live with him in the joy of his
resurrection; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,
now and for ever. Amen.</p>
