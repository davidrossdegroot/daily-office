            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>This website provides daily liturgical resources for the Anglican Daily Office, following the lectionary and collects from <a href="https://bcp2019.anglicanchurch.net/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Book of Common Prayer (2019)</a> of the Anglican Church in North America.</p>

            <h3>Why This Was Made</h3>
            <p>Rising early each morning to locate the readings, collects, and antiphons for Morning Prayer proved challenging, so this project grew out of a desire to simplify and streamline the process.</p>

            <p>The goal was to create a simple, beautiful, and printable resource for daily prayer that follows the traditional Anglican patterns while being accessible on any device.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="office-section">
            <h3>Coming Soon</h3>
            <p><strong>Full 2026 Calendar:</strong> The complete liturgical year for 2026 (all 365 days) is being prepared and will be published once it is complete. Currently, the site contains a partial calendar as the data is being compiled and verified.</p>
